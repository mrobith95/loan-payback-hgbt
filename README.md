# loan-payback-hgbt
Basic ML-based loan payback prediction. Originally a kaggle notebook for kaggle playground competition. Medium article for detailed explanation also available [here](https://medium.com/@mrobith95/loan-payback-prediction-using-histogram-gradient-boosting-trees-d93afa7fc961).

The [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/mrobith95/loan-payback-hgbt/blob/main/loan_payback_pred.ipynb) mainly focuses on in-depth modelling including feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, while also perform basic analysis routine such as data wrangling and ordinal encoding.

The rest of files (except gitignore, licence and this readme) used for [prediction web-app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mrobith95/mr-lpb-0511). The metadata of this web-app can be seen [here.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mrobith95/mr-lpb-0511/blob/main/README.md)
